# Goals

## Primary Objectives (Must-Haves)
- Implement a browser-based whiteboard application using HTML5 Canvas for drawing functionality
- Provide basic drawing tools: pen, lines, shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.), and text insertion
- Enable saving drawings in a versatile format (e.g., JSON, SVG, or custom) that supports export, editing, and sharing
- Ensure fast loading times and responsive performance during drawing operations

## Secondary Objectives (Nice-to-Haves)
- Support for advanced features like undo/redo, zoom, and color picker
- Real-time collaboration capabilities for shared editing
- Integration with cloud storage for seamless sharing and export

# Constraints
- Technology must be limited to browser-native Canvas API or compatible libraries/frameworks
- Application must be lightweight and performant, avoiding heavy frameworks that could impact load times
- Output format must be editable and shareable across different platforms and tools
- Solution should leverage current best practices in web drawing technologies as of 2026

# Risks
- Performance degradation with complex drawings or on lower-end devices/browsers
- Browser compatibility issues across different vendors and versions
- Security vulnerabilities in export/sharing functionality, especially if handling user-generated content
- Choosing an outdated or poorly maintained library that limits future scalability
- Potential conflicts with existing HAAD CLI workflow if integrated as a new feature
