# Goals

## Must-Haves
- Implement basic drawing tools: pen, lines, shapes, text
- Support saving/exporting in a format that allows editing and sharing
- Ensure fast loading and responsive performance

## Nice-to-Haves
- Advanced tools like eraser, undo/redo, color picker
- Real-time collaboration features
- Cloud storage integration
- Export to multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)

# Constraints
- Must be browser-based using HTML5 Canvas API
- Keep the toolset minimal (pen, lines, shapes, text only)
- Prioritize performance for quick loading and smooth interaction
- Align with modern web standards and cross-browser compatibility

# Risks
- Canvas rendering performance issues with complex/large drawings
- Browser compatibility variations affecting drawing accuracy
- Choosing an appropriate file format that supports all required features (export, edit, share)
- Potential security concerns with shared whiteboard data
- Scalability challenges if collaboration features are added later
