### Concept Pitch: HAAD Whiteboard Integration

**What We Are Building:**  
A lightweight, browser-native whiteboard application integrated into the HAAD (Human-Assisted AI Developer) CLI workflow. This tool leverages HTML5 Canvas for real-time drawing, providing essential features like pens, lines, shapes (rectangles, circles), and text insertion. Users can save drawings in editable formats (e.g., JSON or SVG) for export, sharing, and future editing.

**Why We Are Building It:**  
This enhancement addresses the need for visual collaboration and ideation within software development processes. Primary objectives focus on enabling quick, performant sketching and diagramming to support tasks like architecture planning, code design, or user interface prototyping. Secondary features, such as undo/redo, zoom, color pickers, real-time collaboration, and cloud integration, add value for team-based workflows without compromising core functionality. By prioritizing browser-native technologies and fast performance, it minimizes risks like dependency on heavy frameworks, ensuring scalability and compatibility across devices and browsers as of 2026 standards.

**How It Fits Into the Current System:**  
As an optional extension to the HAAD CLI, this whiteboard integrates seamlessly with existing phase artifacts (e.g., Context, Strategy, Architecture Plans) by allowing users to visualize and annotate concepts directly in the browser. It respects the HAAD decision dashboards and templates, storing outputs in shareable formats that can be referenced in project files. Reasonable assumptions include minimal disruption to the CLI workflow—assuming a toggle or command-line flag for activation—and proactive mitigation of risks like performance on low-end devices through canvas optimization and progressive enhancement.

This concept maintains HAAD's focus on human-assisted development while introducing visual tools for more intuitive problem-solving, ready for approval to proceed to detailed planning.
