## Verification Steps
1. Analyze state persistence and validation mechanisms.
2. Assess recovery options for corrupted drawing sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Architecture prevents or detects state corruption.
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms restore valid drawing state.

## Notes
Edge case for data integrity in web app.
