[2026-01-14 18:27:07] [INFO] [ICA] Output generated: ### Concept Pitch: Web-Based Whiteboard Extension for CLI Tool

We propose extending the existing bash-based CLI tool with a new web-based whiteboard feature, enabling users to create and edit visual content directly in a browser environment. This addition would introduce drawing capabilities including pen, lines, shapes, and text input on an HTML5 Canvas, while maintaining the tool's core CLI functionality.

**What We're Building:** A self-contained whiteboard module that integrates with the CLI tool, allowing users to launch a local web server to access a drawing interface. Users can draw freely, add shapes and text, save their work in editable formats like JSON or SVG for sharing and future editing, and export content as needed.

**Why We're Building It:** This addresses user needs for visual collaboration and content creation within the tool's ecosystem. Core requirements include implementing essential drawing tools and ensuring smooth, fast performance for drawing operations, while nice-to-have features like an intuitive UI, undo/redo, and cloud sharing enhance usability and productivity.

**How It Fits Into the Current System:** The whiteboard would run as a separate web component launched from the CLI, requiring a shift from pure bash scripting to incorporating web technologies such as JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas (potentially with frameworks like React for better structure). This modular approach minimizes disruption to the existing CLI codebase—users could invoke the whiteboard via a new command (e.g., `bilu-surf whiteboard`)—while ensuring cross-platform browser compatibility. No existing GUI patterns in the codebase necessitate this architectural evolution, but it builds on the tool's foundation without rewriting everything.

**Key Considerations:** Significant technical changes are involved, including potential adoption of Node.js for the web server. Performance optimizations will be critical for complex drawings, and we'll prioritize modern browser support to mitigate compatibility issues. Scope will be controlled to core features initially, with sharing integrations added iteratively.

This concept enhances the tool's versatility for visual tasks while preserving its CLI roots. Would you like to proceed with development?
