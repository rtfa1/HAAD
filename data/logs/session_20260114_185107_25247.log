## 3. Core Data Models / Signatures
### `DrawingModel`
- **Input**: `Object` (canvas state with fabric objects, history stack)
- **Output**: `Object` (serialized drawing data for export)
- **Description**: Represents the current whiteboard state including canvas elements, undo/redo history, and metadata for saving/exporting.

### `initializeCanvas`
- **Input**: `HTMLCanvasElement` (DOM canvas element)
- **Output**: `fabric.Canvas` (initialized fabric canvas instance)
- **Description**: Sets up the HTML5 Canvas with fabric.js for drawing tools, event listeners, and performance optimizations.

### `exportDrawing`
- **Input**: `fabric.Canvas` (current canvas instance), `String` (format: 'json' or 'svg')
- **Output**: `String` (serialized drawing data)
- **Description**: Serializes the canvas state for export, supporting JSON for state persistence and SVG for vector graphics.

## 4. Configuration Changes
- [ ] **whiteboard/package.json**: Add new file with dependencies (express@4.18.2, fabric@5.3.0) and scripts for starting the server.
- [ ] **README.md**: Update documentation to include the new `whiteboard` command and setup instructions for Node.js dependencies.
- [ ] **.gitignore**: Add `whiteboard/node_modules/` to ignore Node.js dependencies.

Architecture:
# High-Level Architecture Specification

## 1. System Overview
The system is a cross-platform CLI tool that extends its functionality to include a web-based whiteboard application. The core CLI, written in bash, handles user commands and launches a Node.js Express server to serve a browser-based interface. The whiteboard uses HTML5 Canvas with Fabric.js for drawing tools (pen, lines, shapes, text), undo/redo functionality, and export capabilities (JSON/SVG). This modular architecture separates the CLI entry point from the web server and client-side drawing engine, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and minimal disruption to the existing bash-based CLI.

    C --> D[Drawing Engine (HTML5 Canvas + Fabric.js)]
    D --> C
    D --> E[Export Handler]
    E --> F[File System (JSON/SVG Output)]
```

## 3. Data Flow Strategy
- **CLI Command Invocation**: User executes a bash command (e.g., `bilu-surf whiteboard`) via the CLI interface, which spawns the Node.js server process and passes configuration parameters like port and export paths.
- **Server-to-Client Serving**: Node.js server responds to HTTP requests from the browser, delivering static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) and initializing the Canvas drawing surface with Fabric.js.
- **Client Drawing Interactions**: User input (mouse/keyboard events) flows from the browser client to the drawing engine, updating the Canvas state in real-time with drawing tools, history management, and performance optimizations like offscreen rendering.
- **Export Serialization**: Drawing data is serialized from the Canvas (via Fabric.js) into JSON or SVG format, transmitted back through the server to the CLI for file system output, enabling persistence and sharing.

## 4. Design Decisions
- **Modular CLI-Web Separation**: Adopted to preserve the existing bash CLI's simplicity while introducing web technologies for the whiteboard, minimizing technical debt and allowing independent development/testing of components.
- **HTML5 Canvas with Fabric.js**: Chosen for its native browser support, performance optimizations (e.g., integer coordinates, requestAnimationFrame), and built-in features for complex drawing operations, reducing development complexity compared to vanilla Canvas implementations.
- **Node.js Express Server Integration**: Selected for cross-platform server hosting via CLI invocation, leveraging Express's lightweight nature and compatibility with bash scripts to ensure seamless launching without external dependencies beyond Node.js.

## 2. Module Responsibilities
| Module/File | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cli/bilu-surf.sh` | Main bash script serving as the CLI entry point, handling user commands like 'whiteboard', spawning the Node.js server process, and passing configuration parameters such as port and export paths |
| `cli/config.sh` | Bash configuration file defining default settings like server port, export directory paths, and cross-platform compatibility variables |
| `server/package.json` | Node.js package manifest specifying dependencies (e.g., express, fabric.js if needed server-side), scripts for running the server, and project metadata |
| `server/server.js` | Express server implementation handling HTTP requests, serving static web assets, initializing the whiteboard application, and managing server-side logic for exports |
| `server/routes/index.js` | Express routes module defining API endpoints for client-server communication, including routes for initializing the drawing surface and handling export requests |
| `server/public/assets/css/styles.css` | Server-side CSS assets served to the client, providing base styles for the web interface |
| `server/public/assets/js/fabric.min.js` | Minified Fabric.js library served as a static asset to the client for drawing engine functionality |
| `client/index.html` | Main HTML file for the web client, containing the Canvas element and loading client-side JavaScript/CSS |
| `client/js/app.js` | Client-side JavaScript initializing the web application, setting up event listeners for user interactions, and coordinating between drawing engine and export handler |
| `client/js/drawing-engine.js` | Core drawing functionality using HTML5 Canvas and Fabric.js, implementing tools (pen, lines, shapes, text), undo/redo, and real-time updates with performance optimizations |

## 1. Validation Status
| Check | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architectural Coverage** | Pass | All architectural components (CLI Interface, Node.js Server, Web Client, Drawing Engine, Export Handler, File System) are represented in the structure plan through corresponding modules (cli/, server/, client/ directories and specific files like drawing-engine.js, export-handler.js). |
| **Baseline Alignment** | Fail | Directory structure mismatch: Baseline proposes a simple 'whiteboard/' subdirectory with basic files, while Structure Plan uses a more modular root-level organization (cli/, server/, client/). Dependencies (express, fabric) align, but placement differs (fabric as client asset in Structure vs. general dependency in Baseline). Data models are covered by client/js files. |
| **Completeness** | Pass | All defined modules have clear responsibilities and the structure accounts for server routes, client assets, and CLI configuration. No obvious missing components. |

## 2. Gap Analysis
- [ ] **Directory Structure Inconsistency**: Baseline assumes a 'whiteboard/' subdirectory with package.json at that level, but Structure Plan distributes files across root-level cli/, server/, client/ directories, potentially causing integration issues with CLI invocation and dependency management.
- [ ] **Fabric.js Dependency Placement**: Baseline lists fabric as a project dependency, but Structure Plan places it as a static asset in server/public/assets/js/, which may require manual download/management instead of npm installation.
- [ ] **Configuration Integration**: Baseline specifies .gitignore and README.md updates, but Structure Plan includes these implicitly without explicit config.sh handling for cross-platform variables.

## 3. Recommendations
- [ ] Standardize directory structure to match Baseline's 'whiteboard/' container or update Baseline to reflect modular organization, ensuring consistent CLI launching and dependency scoping.
- [ ] Clarify fabric.js handling as npm dependency in server/package.json or baseline, rather than manual asset placement, to enable proper versioning and updates.
- [ ] Add explicit integration points in Structure Plan for config.sh variables (port, paths) in bilu-surf.sh and server.js to address baseline configuration requirements.
